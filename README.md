## Project Overview

The Message Board project is a full-stack application that consists of two separate repositories:

- **Frontend** (this repository): Handles the user interface, allowing users to interact with the application by writing and submitting messages.
- **Backend** ([link to backend repository](https://github.com/AxiomaticAdi/message-board-back)): Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. It communicates with the frontend to provide the necessary data for displaying messages.

## Stack Used

The Message Board project utilizes the following stack:

### Frontend

- **Vite.js**: A fast and modern frontend build tool that enables rapid development and efficient code bundling.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Basic web technologies used for creating the user interface and implementing client-side functionality.

### Backend

- **Express.js**: A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that handles server-side logic, routing, and communication with the database.
- **Firebase Realtime Database**: A cloud-hosted NoSQL database used for storing all historical messages in real time.

## Features

- Users can write messages in the input field and submit them.
- The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch and display all historical messages.
